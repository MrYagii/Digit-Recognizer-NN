Project Title: Sochimazuru's Digit Recognizer

Description:
This project is a digit recognition web application built using Flask and PyTorch. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset to predict handwritten digits (0-9). The app allows users to upload an image, and the model will predict the digit in the image.

Requirements:
?Python 3.7 or above
?PyTorch
?Flask
?PIL (Python Imaging Library)
?torchvision

Installation:
1.Clone or download the project:
Download the project files to your local machine.
2.Install dependencies:
Install the required Python packages using pip:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Alternatively, you can manually install dependencies:
bash
pip install torch torchvision flask pillow
3. Download or train the model:
- If you have a pre-trained model (digit_model.pth), place it in the project folder.
- Alternatively, you can train the model using the provided training scripts, and then save the model as digit_model.pth.

Running the App:
1.Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Run the app:
bash
python app.py
The Flask development server will start. Open your browser and navigate to:
cpp
http://127.0.0.1:5000
You can now upload an image of a handwritten digit, and the app will predict the digit for you.

Disclaimer:
"Sochimazuru's Digit Recognizer needs a properly formatted image (28x28 pixels, grayscale) to predict accurately."

Usage:
1.Upload a grayscale image of a handwritten digit.
2.The app will process the image, use the trained model to predict the digit, and display the result on the webpage.

Troubleshooting:
?If you encounter any issues with image size or format, ensure that the input image is 28x28 pixels and in grayscale format. The model expects the image to be of this specific size for accurate predictions.
